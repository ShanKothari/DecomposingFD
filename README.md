# DecomposingFD
Code to calculate functional trait diversity as defined by Scheiner et al. (2016), and its decomposition into richness, evenness, and dispersion.

## Status of package
This is planned package, though currently it is just one poorly annotated script. Stay tuned for expansions!

## How to use
Currently, the best way to use this script is to download the script (or close the repository) and source the functions into R. AlphaFD.R contains two functions -- FTD, which calculates functional trait dispersion for a single community based on its species and their traits, and FTD.comm, which wraps FTD across a set of communities. Each function also calculates how FTD is decomposed into species richness, functional evenness, and functional dispersion.
